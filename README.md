# Breast Cancer Detection using Histopathology Images

## Overview

This project focuses on utilizing histopathology images to detect breast cancer. The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle, and the detection model was built using the VGG16 architecture and Keras Tuner. The model achieved an accuracy and precision of 84%.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [Kaggle Breast Cancer Histopathological Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images/data)

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access and use the dataset according to Kaggle's terms and conditions.

## Model Architecture

The breast cancer detection model is built on the VGG16 architecture, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. Keras Tuner was employed to optimize the hyperparameters of the model, enhancing its performance.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:

- Python (version 3.10.12)
- TensorFlow (version 2.13.0)
- Keras (version 2.13.1)
- Keras Tuner (version 1.3.5)
- Other required libraries

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy and precision of 0.8457015409570154 and  0.8421157884211579 for VGG16 model and Precision and accuracy is 0.8570839348319241 and 0.8474152584741526 for keras-tuner, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting breast cancer from histopathology images.

## Future Work
Research Paper:
Document the methodology, results, and insights gained from this project to contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the field of breast cancer detection using histopathology images.

Website Hosting:
Develop and host a website where users can interact with the model, submit images for analysis, and access information about breast cancer detection.
